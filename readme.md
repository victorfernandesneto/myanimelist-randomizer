# MyAnimeList Randomizer

### How to run:

- Have a Client ID (register one at MAL website);
- Download the .zip;
- Set your environment variable CLIENT_ID to your client ID. `export CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT ID"` (for Linux)

- Run `src/main/java/com/victorfernandesneto/malrandomizer/MalRandomizerApplication.java`.

### How to request

When live, request by sending get to either `/anime` or `/manga` with the "username" header.

### Future improvements

I deployed the app in AWS but the only CORS Allowed is the localhost. If any front-end developers want to work with a cool interface, hmu.

Going to post a video soon (in Portuguese, maybe I'll sub in English) explaining the architecture and motivation.
