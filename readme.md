# MyAnimeList Randomizer

### How to run:

- Have a Client ID (register one at MAL website);
- Download the .zip;
- Create a folder inside `src/main` called `resources` that should contain: 

```
api.url=https://api.myanimelist.net/v2/users/{username}/animelist?limit=1&offset={offset}
client.id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```

- Run `src/main/java/com/victorfernandesneto/myanimelistrandomizer/main/App.java`.
- Input your username.
- Watch your anime!

### Future improvements

I want to add filters to watching, watched, dropped, plan to watch so the user can have a more complete experience.
